#### Unit 4 - London Case Study
Analyzed London Borough data to determine the greatest average increase in housing prices over (approximately) two decades.

#### Unit 6 - Capstone One
Compared data from various ski resorts to create pricing models for target resort in order to offset a recent increase in operational cost.

#### Unit 7 - API Data Wrangling
Retrieved data using Quandl API to analyze performance of certain stocks.

#### Unit 8 - Country Club Case Study
Connected to a SQLite database to gather various member information and activity availabilities at a country club.

#### Unit 11 - Statistics in Exploratory Data Analysis
##### Frequentist Inference Case Study
Used the central limit theorem to help apply frequentist techniques to answer questions that pertain to very non-normally distributed data from the real world. Also formed null and alternate hypotheses that were t-tested.
